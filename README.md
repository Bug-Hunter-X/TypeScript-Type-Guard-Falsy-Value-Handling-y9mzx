This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript related to type guards and how they interact with falsy values.  The `greet` function is designed to handle null values gracefully, but it fails when passed `undefined`, even though undefined could be considered a falsy value in Javascript.  The solution showcases a more robust approach using optional chaining and the nullish coalescing operator.
